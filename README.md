## Objective

- `Build a React.js Music Application`

## Technologies

- `React.js (Next.js)`
- `APIs:`
  Use Shazam API to gather music data
  Use Shazam Core API to gather artist details and recommended tracks
  Use IP Geolocation API to get the user’s location
- `Libraries:`
  You may use any libraries and packages you might need in your code
  You may also use any UI kit you prefer (Material UI, Tailwind, Plain CSS…)
  You may use Redux Toolkit to keep the API calls organized

## Functionalities

- `Music Player`
  Users can click on any song, and a music player will appear. The player must include basic controls such as previous song, next song, and pause/play buttons. Additional details such as the song’s name, author, volume, repeat, and duration controls are a plus.
- `Homepage`
  Users can choose a genre and get top songs for that genre
- `Explore`
  Users can select a country and get top songs for that country
- `Music for Specific Country`
   Show the top songs for the user’s country
- `Artists Page`
   Users can see a list of the most famous artists
- `Artist Details Page`
   Users can see additional information about the artist and all of their most popular songs.
- `Song Details Page`
  Users can see additional information about the song, such as the song’s music video and lyrics and a list of similar songs.

## Bonus Points

- `Search Functionality`
  Users can start typing artists or song names, and results based on their search will show up.
- `Exceptional Design`
   Make your design stand out; everyone loves a beautiful user interface. Brand it as a real app and stay consistent with the colors, icons, and design.
- `Additional Features`
  Have you thought of some possible extra functionalities with APIs mentioned above? Go wild!
- `Clean Code`
  We cannot emphasize enough how important this is! Keep the code clean and use as many React best practices as possible.
